            <!-- Introductory text -->
            <p>I’m an undergraduate developer currently employed full-time as a full-stack software developer. I’m interested in pursuing higher education in the fields of Computer Science, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing.</p>
            <p>I have two years of industry experience working in software development. I specialize in front-end programming and have several web projects in my portfolio actively hosted by companies from many countries. I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering, and my final thesis involved research on Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis.</p>

            <!-- Selected Projects -->
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>

                <small>14/10/2022 – Current</small>
            </h3>
            <p>Worked as the developer and maintainer of Worki.mn, an HR application for connecting employers with employees. I specialized in Microservices using Java Spring Boot and managed system administration, as well as deployment in Docker and Kubernetes for the development of new features and maintenance of existing architecture.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>Co-founded “Alhay”, or "Let's Walk!" in Mongolian, a local startup founded between colleagues and friends from our University to contribute to certain issues present within our country such as air pollution, and highly congested traffic. This application promotes healthy commuting habits by rewarding users for traveling on foot, rather than in vehicles. Based on our research, the idea is that it effectively incentivizes less traffic usage which, in turn, should prove beneficial to the aforementioned problems. The project is in active development, and we are set to launch by Q1 2023! </p>
